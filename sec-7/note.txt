document in mongodb is kind of similar a row is relational db
relational db have table and row  mongo db have collaction and document
is document is container of key value pair
_id  --> is uniq identifier 
tag--> key value pair
date

__v  version
in mongoose we have a consept call schima  
this is specfic to monggose not part of mongodb
we use schima in mongoose to define shape of document
in mongodb collection 

class schima from mongoose
new mongoose.schima({})
schima type
string 
number
date
buffer
boolean
objectID
array

6--- model
mongoose.model(,) take two arg
first arg is singular name of collection model 
second arg  shape of document 
then const Class= mongoose.model("name collection","pattern schima")
then data=new Class({name:"emilia",...) with look schima fill data


7---  save   data
await data.save()  is async opreation
best practise this instanse from class filled data and save pack into a async funtion
